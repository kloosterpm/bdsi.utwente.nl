A 45 minute guided introduction to data wrangling in _R_, using the 'tidy' data principles. [Karel Kroeze](/team/#k-a-kroeze) will show how to prepare a 'raw' dataset for analysis, by cleaning, reshaping and mutating the data until it has shown us all its secrets.

This workshop is also open for those who do not want to participate in the Data Science Week. You can sign up for just the Tidy Data Wrangling workshop using the button below. Note that if you've already signed up for the Data Science week, you do not need to sign up for this event again.
