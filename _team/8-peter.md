*WHO:* I'm a researcher and all-round data and methodology enthusiast. Much of my research is focused on health outcomes analysis and predictive modelling. I also have extensive applied experience in developing and validating tests and questionnaires, using both modern and classic psychometric analysis techniques. I teach courses in assessment and advanced research methods, such as experience sampling (longitudinal intensive measurement). I have experience with different statistical software environments and programs, including R and Mplus.

*ROLE:* I represent the department of Technology, Human and Institutional Behaviour (HIB) in BDSI.

*NEED HELP:* I 'm happy to help you with questions about the optimal design, statistical analysis and power calculations for your observational or intervention studies. I can also support you with measurement development and evaluation projects and with different types of multilevel and latent variable modelling analyses such as structural equation modelling.
